// account was ever a merchant — reported live: "when i logged in, it did
// not read the customerType, it entered as a regular individual". Keyed by
// email (not just "the last known type") so a second account logging in on
// the same browser doesn't inherit the first account's type. This is a

// a genuinely new browser/device still can't know an account's type until
