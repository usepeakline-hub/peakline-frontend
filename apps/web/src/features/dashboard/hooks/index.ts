/**
 * The account's real, single balance display — combined from BOTH real
 * sources on purpose, after each turned out to be individually incomplete
 * in opposite directions, reported live both ways:
 *
 * - `GET /wallets/stellar`'s own `balances` (via `useMyWallet`) is "live
 *   from Horizon" for USDC — accurate for anything that actually moved on
 *   the Stellar network (the testnet faucet, an external wallet sending
 *   USDC in) — but a purely-internal transfer from another Peakline user
 *   settles through the ledger with NO on-chain movement at all (confirmed
 *   live: `SendMoneyResponseDto.stellarTxHash` is null for that case), so
 *   this alone can show nothing for money just received from another
 *   Peakline account.
 * - `GET /transactions/balances` is the ledger's own rollup, which does
 *   capture internal transfers, but can just as easily miss funds added
 *   outside any recorded transaction row (the testnet faucet is a raw
 *   Friendbot call, not something that creates one).
 *
 * These are two views of the *same* real balance, not additive deltas, so
 * taking the higher of the two per currency is what actually covers both
 * cases: the higher figure is never wrong, only the lower one risks being
 * stale relative to whichever source hasn't caught up yet.
 *
 * Reshaped into the same "primary + local" `WalletBalanceSummary` shape
 * every consumer (`BalanceCard`, `WalletBalanceCard`, the Send/Fund/Pay
 * success + validation steps) already expects. No separate branch for "no
 * wallet yet" — same as `WalletBalanceCard`, that's a real `0.00`, not an
 * error, and a failed/erroring source just contributes `0` rather than
 * blocking the other one from showing.
